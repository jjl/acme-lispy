NAME
    Acme::Lispy - How not to write lisp in perl

SYNOPSIS
      use Acme::Lispy;
      (if 1) {
        (print "Marvel at my s-expressions!")
      } (elsif 0) {
        (let $x 1 $y 2)
        1 + 2
        (print "I am a thing of beauty")
      }

DESCRIPTION
    Basically, this adds a lisp source filter on top of perl for no good
    reason whatsoever. I wouldn't use it. I'd be surprised if it even
    compiles, but the theory is sound.
